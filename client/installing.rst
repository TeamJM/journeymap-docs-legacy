Installing
==========

JourneyMap can be found `on CurseForge`_. This is the only legitimate place to download it from -
if you see it on another website then please avoid downloading it from there. **Copies of
JourneyMap obtained from unofficial sources may be old, broken or contain viruses, and they
break our license.**

Video Guide

If you prefer a video guide, the below video will show you how to install Forge for 
`the official Minecraft launcher`_. You can apply these instructions to any version of Minecraft -
not just Minecraft 1.15.2.

Textual Guide
-------------

If you prefer a more complete guide you can read and follow along with at your own pace, then you can follow these
instructions:

1. Decide how you're going to work with Minecraft. Some options include (from easiest to hardest):

   * `The Twitch client`_
   * `MultiMC`_
   * `The official Minecraft launcher`_

   We recommend MultiMC for ease of use, but any launcher will work just fine.

2. Ensure that you have a copy of Java installed. If not, you can download a copy
   from the `AdoptOpenJDK website`_.

   Most mods are intended to be run under Java 8, and JourneyMap is no exception.
   Please ensure that you aren't using a newer version of Java to run Minecraft.

3. Install Forge. You should **always use the recommended version of Forge** for your
   version of Minecraft. You can also check the changelog for the version of JourneyMap
   you're downloading if you'd like to see what version of Forge we've used.

   * If you're using `the official Minecraft launcher`_, you can follow
     `this guide from RockPaperShotgun`_.
   * If you're using `MultiMC`_, create a new instance for the Minecraft version you 
     wish to use. Edit that instance, select **Version** on the left, and then click on
     **Install Forge** on the right, and select the version you want to use.
   * If you're using `the Twitch client`_, click on **Mods** at the top and select
     **Minecraft**, and create a new profile with the version of Minecraft you want.

4. Go to the `files page on CurseForge`_ and download the latest version of
   JourneyMap for your version of Minecraft.
   
   * If you're using `the Twitch client`_, then you can click on the Twitch 
     button next to the version you'd like to use and it'll be installed for 
     you. Otherwise, click the download button and wait for the JAR to finish
     downloading.
   * If you're using `MultiMC`_, edit the instance you're using, select **Loader mods** on the
     left, and then drag-and-drop the JAR you downloaded into the list on the right.
   * If you're using `the official Minecraft launcher`_, find the **mods** folder
     for your Forge profile and copy the JAR you downloaded into it.

   If no download is available for your version of Minecraft, then we
   haven't released one yet! Please have patience - JourneyMap is a 
   large, complicated mod and it takes a long time for us to port it 
   to new versions of Minecraft.

5. That's everything, you're done - launch the game and JourneyMap should be availble!
