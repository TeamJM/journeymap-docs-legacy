Waypoints
=========

Waypoints allow you to mark specific locations on your map, in order
to keep track of those locations or easily find your way back to them
later.

By default, they're shown using a coloured beacon beam, and the name
of the waypoint will be displayed when you look towards it - but
this behaviour can be changed in the :ref:`settings manager <settings>`.
